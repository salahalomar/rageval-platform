"""Cross-encoder reranking.

A bi-encoder embeds the query and the passage independently, so it can never see how
they relate -- the two vectors are computed before either knows the other exists. A cross
-encoder concatenates them into a single input and attends across the pair, which is why
it consistently reorders results a bi-encoder got wrong, and why it cannot be indexed:
every (query, passage) pair needs its own forward pass. That is the whole trade. Fifty
forward passes on CPU per query is the price of the largest single quality jump in the
system, and the ablation table shows both columns rather than only the flattering one.

Two things here are worth stating rather than assuming.

**Scores are probabilities in [0, 1], not logits.** The model head emits a single logit,
and `sentence_transformers.CrossEncoder` applies `Sigmoid()` to it by default for
single-label models -- so what comes back here is already squashed. This was checked
rather than assumed, and the assumption it replaced was wrong in a way that mattered: a
`score_floor` of 0.0 against a [0, 1] score means *never refuse*, which is exactly the
failure that reasoning about logits was supposed to avoid. Measured floors and their
observed separation live in `RetrievalConfig.score_floor`.

**The 512-token window truncates.** The model encodes `[CLS] query [SEP] passage [SEP]`,
and chunks in this corpus have a median of 477 tokens. Pairs therefore overflow, and the
passage tail is dropped. That is inherent to the model, not a bug to fix here -- but it is
measured (`truncated_pairs`) rather than left invisible, because a reranker silently
judging the first two-thirds of a chunk is exactly the kind of thing that quietly caps
recall.
