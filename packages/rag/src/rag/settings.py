"""Process-level environment configuration -- deliberately separate from RetrievalConfig.

The distinction matters and is worth stating plainly: `RetrievalConfig` describes an
experiment and is embedded verbatim in every evaluation result, while `Settings`
describes where the process happens to be running. A database URL does not change what
gets retrieved, so recording it alongside a metric would be noise; a chunk size does,
so it lives in the config.

ENGINEERING.md forbids the retrieval path from reading environment variables directly.
This module is the single place in the library that touches the environment at all.
